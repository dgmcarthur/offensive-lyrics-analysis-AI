# Analyzing Offensive Language in Music Using Machine Learning
This project serves as a proof-of-concept for a new approach in analyzing explicit language in music. The core idea is to utilize Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence to provide a more fine-grained analysis of offensive language in music, as opposed to a binary explicit or clean. After examining the previous research in this general subject matter, as well as considering several different ways to go about the work, I ultimately decided to import a Python library called [alt-profanity-check](https://gitlab.com/dimitrios/alt-profanity-check). I could use its probability rating to give a better estimate of how explicit a given track was. I tested this thinking on a dataset of a few songs and compared it with Spotifyâ€™s own explicit labels. It proved to be quite accurate, so I ran it on a larger dataset and looked at the results by genre and by decade. In the end I found that using NLP for music analysis is helpful, and that this line of thinking is also beneficial. Going forward, it would be better to tailor a new machine learning algorithm to song lyrics.
